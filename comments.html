            <p>The website follows a concise structure, illustrated to the right. Each page features a main title, navigational bar, subheading, page contents and a footer.</p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="container">
        <h4>Main Title</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Has the largest font-size in the website, utilising the h1 tag.</li>
            <li>Uses a centered text-align to be more prominent, catch the eye, and increase its presentability to the user.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class='container'>
        <h4>Navigational Bar</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Features a minimalist style, with only top and bottom borders of white solid 1px lines.</li>
            <li>The navigation bar is padded with 15px, has a font-size of 25px and is aligned in the center.</li>
            <li>When the mouse hovers over a link, the text becomes underlined to assist the user in being more apparent.</li>
            <li>Utilises an ID '#activenav' which colours the current page's link to navy to indicate the users whereabouts on the website.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class='container'>
        <h4>Subheading</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses the h3 tag to catch the users eye and provide context to what page they are currently on.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class='container'>
        <h4>Page Contents</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The page contents utilise various classes and ID's, including:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>.container - features a curved border, light blue background div. the class has a navy border-left, creating a stylistic touch that adds to the page's aesthetic.</li>
                <li>.containerimage - this class is used solely for images, it is similar in appearance to the class .container however it has a complete 4px navy border around it and the same background-colour. This class is used on the 'Past Experiences' page.</li>
                <li>.containerleft - this class is used to display text on the left with an image on the right, evident above on this page and on the 'Future' page. The class also features a navy solid border, with identical colours of white text and a light-blue background colour. This class was implemented to create diversity on the page rather than just using the .container class.</li>
                <li>.footer - used on each page, this class adds a footer feature that conveys my name, a copyright and a 'Back to top' link that furthers the functionality on my website for the user.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Multiple ID's are used on my website including:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>#nav, #activenav, #opaque, #footer -
                        these ID's were created for aesthetical purposes, adding some extra improvements to the websites aesthetic.</li>
                    <li>#filetable, #photoofme, #websitestructure, #palette, #textlink, #gotop - these ID's were created to add functionality and set necessary parameters of images and tables such as the 'border-collapse' and 'float' properties.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class='container'>
        <h4>Page Footer</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The mindset behind implementing a footer was mainly to use it as a location for the 'Back to Top' button. Including this link on my website provides a more user-friendly experience, while also furthering the technicality of the website. </li>
            <li>The footer also demonstrates the use of the span tag, particularly on the &#169; symbol and my name.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <!-- Aesthetical Aspects Section -->

    <a name="aesthetics"></a>
    <h3>Aesthetical Aspects</h3>
    <div class='container'>
        <p>This website embodies a contemporary style through its minimalistic aspects and user-friendly colour schemes, boasting an aesthetically pleasing yet easily interpreted series of pages.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class='container'>
        <h4>Colours</h4>
        <p>Being a portentous aspect of every website, I decided to employ a cool-toned colour scheme consisting of various blues, contrastingly complimenting the white and pink text. The usage of white text and baby pink headings not only catches the viewer's eye, yet also combinates smoothly with the blue shades into a polished colour scheme.</p>
        <p>The disparate shades of blue with the baby pink and white text remain consisent throughout all pages on the website, subsequentially displaying all the pages' elements in a distinguishable fashion. The colour palette is viewed below. </p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <img id="palette" src="images/colourPalette.PNG" alt="Website colour palette">

    <br>

    <div class='container'>
        <h4>Fonts</h4>
        <p>Careful consideration was undergone when allocating a font to my website, as user-accesibility is of utmost importance. Due to its easy readability and prevalence across different browsers, the sans-serif font family is the set font on the website, with alternate fonts also specified in the stylesheet.</p>
        <p>Some text on the website such as the navigation bar, or page title have and underlining to aid the user, likewise text-size has been enlargened to enhance readability of my website.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class='container'>
        <h4>Structure</h4>
        <p>The consistent, vertical structure of my website results in a minimal yet appealing design. The bordered navigation bar and centered containers provide the user with an easily interpreted layout. All of the content is reponsive, allowing different various screen sizes such as mobile devices to view the website with ease.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class='container'>
        <h4>Interactivity</h4>
        <p>Despite the lack of JavaScript across the website, various features have been implemented to enhance the interactivity of the website. Hovering the mouse over certain text such as the navigation bar or 'go to top' link will result in alternate text. These incorporations boost not only the interactivity but also consequently the user-friendliness.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class='container'>
        <h4>Page Fade-In Effect</h4>
        <p>Without the use of JavaScript, a straightforward pagefade was acheived in conjunction with the user <a id="textlink" href="https://auth.geeksforgeeks.org/user/sayantanm19/articles">sayantanm19's</a> intuitive <a id="textlink" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-fade-in-effect-on-page-load-using-css/"> article</a>. This simple page fade-in is effectuated anytime a new page is loaded, adding a touch of spice to the website.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Accessability Concerns Section -->

    <h3>Accessability Concerns</h3>
    <div class='container'>
        <p>The development of this website has been done in accordance with <a id="textlink" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative</a> to ensure accesibility for all users is sustained.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class='container'>
        <h3>Font Sizing, Spacing, Selection</h3>
        <p>Appropriate sizing of font has been maintained across the website, where every text element maintains a large font size for visually impaired users. Font sizes have been specified in percentage form to optimise smaller screen usage.</p>
        <p>Font spacing has been increased in some sections of the website to increase both the aesthetic and the accessibility of the website, evident in the navigation bar and footer.</p>
        <p>As addressed in the <a href="#aesthetics">Aesthetical Aspects</a> section, the generic font-family sans-serif was selected due to its letter-distinctivity and lack of decorative flourishes that other families such as serif possess. Alternate fonts have also been specified in the stylesheet in case of a font being unsupported by the users browser. Additionally, there is little use of bolding, italicising or underlining within the website, rather only on links to aid the user.
        </p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class='container'>
        <h3>Assistive Technologies</h3>
        <p>The website has been appropriately designed to accomodate the usage of assistive technologies such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Screen readers</li>
            <li>Text readers</li>
            <li>Speech input software</li>
            <li>Screen magnification software</li>
            <li>Alternative input devices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To accomodate these assistive technologies when accessing my website, necessary adjustments have been made including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alt text for every image for technologies such as screen readers</li>
            <li>Lack of images with text for text reading technologies</li>
            <li>No input forms on the website for speech input software</li>
            <li>Responsive font size for magnification software and different device screen-dimensions</li>
            <li>The website remains completely functional through the use of keyboard for alternative input devices</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class='container'>
        <h3>Colour Usage</h3>
        <p>Selecting an appropriate colour scheme for my website was of major importance. The multiple shades of blue accompanied by contrasting white and baby pink text gurantee colourblind users can interpret the website. Particular attention was paid to users with tritanopia and their anomalous blue cones; however with the use of external tools such as <a id="textlink" href="https://www.rgblind.se/">RGBlind</a> and <a id="textlink" href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/">Toptal</a>, usability for colourblind users was ensured.</p>
