        <p>I have always enjoyed using computers from a young age, either playing games or doing work on them. My experiences stem from Windows computers as I've never owned anything else; however, I have done some minor tinkering with Linux during my highschool.</p>

        <p>Throughout my first year at highschool I enrolled in the subject 'Information Software Technology' otherwise known as 'IST', during which I was tasked with creating a simple webpage - observed below. The webpage was quite basic, it wasn't hosted, lacked a CSS page, yet it served as a great introduction to learning HTML.</p>

        <p>This screenshot is from the main page of my first webpage. It features a default white background, with a single image and a few dropdown boxes. This webpage served to be my first experience with HTML and greatly assisted me with learning fundamental skills that I have applied across this website.</p>

        <p>Other than my IST classes during highschool, I haven't had much else experience. This assessment task has proved extremely beneficial for me, as it has allowed me to progress my skills in developing a fuctional website utilising both HTML and CSS.</p>
